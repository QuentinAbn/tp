# Practices - Data engineering

## TP - Data processing with Apache Spark
To process a large amount of data partitioned on a data lake, you can use data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark :
1. Read : https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html

Some questions :
* What is Spark RDD API ? 
The Spark RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) API is a core API of Apache Spark, which is an open-source distributed computing framework. RDD is a fundamental data structure in Spark that represents an immutable, fault-tolerant distributed collection of data that can be processed in parallel across a cluster of machines.
* What is Spark Dataset API ?
The Spark Dataset API is an API of Apache Spark that is an extension of the DataFrame API. It provides an object-oriented programming interface to manipulate structured and semi-structured data using Spark.
* With which languages can you use Spark ? 
It can be used with various programming languages such as Java, Scala, Python, R, or SQL.
* Which data sources or data sinks can Spark work with ? 
File systems, Relational databases, NoSQL databases, etc


### Analyse data with Apache Spark and Scala 
One engineering team of your company created for you a TV News data stored as JSON inside the folder `data-news-json/`.

Your goal is to analyze it with your savoir-faire, enrich it with metadata, and store it as [a column-oriented format](https://parquet.apache.org/).

1. Look at `src/main/scala/com/github/polomarcus/main/Main.scala` and update the code 

**Important note:** As you work for a top-notch software company following world-class practices, and you care about your project quality, you'll write a test for every function you write.

You can see tests inside `src/test/scala/` and run them with `sbt test`

### How can you deploy your app to a cluster of machines ?

### Business Intelligence (BI)
How could use we Spark to display data on a BI tool such as [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) ?

### Continuous build and test
**Pro Tips** : https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Running.html#Continuous+build+and+test

Make a command run when one or more source files change by prefixing the command with ~. For example, in sbt shell try:
```bash
sbt
> ~ testQuick
```
